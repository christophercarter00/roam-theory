        <h2>Columbus to Cheyenne: The Road Trip That Changed My View on Travel</h2>
        <p class="text-muted">Published on: 03/06/2025</p>
        <p><strong>The open sky detailing the outline of each star, both near and far, bright and dull, sparkling or still.</strong> Every plane pushing through the darkness, the distant view of a crescent moon, all paired with the silence of night—<em>the euphoria that I continue to chase, the reason that I roam.</em></p>
        <p>No nearby towns. No light pollution. <strong>Not a car in sight—just us and the empty highway</strong> stretching through the rural Midwest, the heartland of our country.</p>
        <p>We pulled the car over to the side of the road, and as I shifted my weight to step out, <em>it hit me.</em> The tenseness in my muscles after hours in a car, the stiffness settling in. But more than that, <strong>a power swept through my body from head to toe.</strong></p>
        <p>Standing there in the darkness of night, experiencing a cold breeze, and smelling the open air with my closest friends, <strong>a fire ignited within me—one that has continued to be the driving factor in my curiosity for growth and discovery.</strong></p>
        <p>This fire has allowed me to accept new challenges, experience new opportunities, and never turn down a road trip, whether it's short or far, from one state to another, or from one coast to the other.</p>
        <p>The night sky that evening, at 2 AM in western Iowa, introduced me to a sense of freedom and a newfound love for the stillness of night. And even though I have always been drawn to city life, <strong>I long for the day I leave the city lights for the night sky.</strong></p>
        <p><em>In that moment, staring up at the infinite sky, I didn’t realize just how much this night would change me.</em></p>
        <p>The start of <strong>The Roam Theory</strong> and my chase for growth began ten years ago on my first cross-country road trip from Columbus, Ohio, to Cheyenne, Wyoming. At the start of Thanksgiving break in my freshman year of college, four of us crammed into a BMW X3 and left on a Sunday afternoon, immediately following the end of a three-day college swim meet. We drove through one state after another, seeing the landscape of our country change as we progressed further west before making our only stop, 18 hours later, in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>
        <p><strong>We covered over 3,000 miles, from Columbus to Cheyenne, before ending back in the rolling hills of the Appalachian Mountains in Elkins, West Virginia.</strong> Having spent well over two days straight in a car, it introduced me to a new perspective on travel.</p>
        <p>Before this expedition, I thought travel was about new sights and experiences. But when I returned to school, <strong>I realized it was something deeper—an internal shift, a transformation.</strong> If it were not for the push from an English professor that semester, I would have never learned to reflect upon past experiences and to let the thoughts and emotions fill my mind, begging to be let out, begging to be expressed and shared with the world.</p>
        <p><em>A vision I’ve withheld for years, kept to myself, waiting for the strength to take the next step—especially as a writer.</em></p>
        <p>The act of movement is what creates this impact on you, both internally and externally. Traveling not only teaches us how to reflect and view things of the past, but it also teaches us how to enjoy the things along the way. <strong>The conversations you share, the music you discover, the podcasts you had always skipped over, or even the eye-opening, life-changing opportunity to see the night sky in a way you’ve never seen before.</strong></p>
        <p>For me, travel is about curiosity, about the revelations you discover, and about taking a deeper look at how we interact with the world.</p>
        <p><strong>That brisk fall night in Iowa is where The Roam Theory began. It’s why I roam, and it’s why I invite you to do the same.</strong></p>
        <p><em><strong>Welcome to The Roam Theory.</strong></em></p>
